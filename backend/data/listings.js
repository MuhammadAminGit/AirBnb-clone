Lark Street is often referred to as the “Greenwich Village” of Albany’s Capital Region. The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance. <br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "If you visit Albany’s Capital Region without seeing Lark Street, then you have indeed missed its unique and funky urban center. Lark Street is often referred to as the “Greenwich Village” of Albany’s Capital Region. The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance.<br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",
